For KNIME the preparation steps are quickly summarised, no matter what the actual course content will be.

## Installing KNIME Image Processing Extension (KNIP).

KNIME is focused on data analysis and mining in their large sense. The image analysis package in KNIME has to be installed as an extension. The installation instructions and quick overview of the KNIME Image Processing Extension can be found [here](https://tech.knime.org/community/image-processing).
