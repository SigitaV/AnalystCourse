#Analysis of point clouds: useful information @ NEUBIAS Bioimage Analyst Course

##Aims of this course

In this workshop we will present various analytical methods designed to quantify single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data directly from the localization coordinates. It aims at guiding users for choosing the most appropriate methods to their problem. As a support, we will use simulation and experimental data. All the quantifications will be done with SR-Tesseler, a stand-alone software running on a Windows environment.
