# Preparation steps for the ImageJ2 workshop.

By Curtis Rueden.

-------------

## Installation of tools.

Students should follow the `Setting up a Java development environment for Fiji and friends` instructions. On top of this, we ask you to install [Beaker Notebook](  http://beakernotebook.com/).


## Preparation steps.

Students need to be familiar with Fiji; I will assume students have already studied the three main intro workshops:

- https://imagej.github.io/presentations/fiji-introduction/#/
- https://imagej.github.io/presentations/fiji-segmentation/#/
- https://imagej.github.io/presentations/fiji-scripting/#/

For extra credit, students could peruse the Ops workshop:

- https://imagej.github.io/presentations/2015-09-04-imagej2-scripting/#/
- https://vimeo.com/140098817, https://vimeo.com/140098835

Students will not need advance knowledge of Beaker nor Eclipse.

I will of course assume that students are familiar with the basics of quantitative digital image analysis. Students with any doubt can consult the following slides from BioDIP:

- http://workshops.imagej.net/Basics-of-Quantitative-image-analysis.pdf

(I am guessing that those slides look very familiar to J-Y... ;-)
